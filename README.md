<h1>Amazon Web Scraper and Notifier</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project is a simple Amazon web scraper and notifier using the Python3 coding language. It utilizes many packages to scan and pull data from an Amazon webpage, interpret it, and then send the user an email notification if the item has fallen into the price they would want to purchase it at. I actually used this program to track the price of Airpods and bought them when they fell below the price I wanted! Utilized the "requests" Python package to pull the webpage into an HTML format. Utilized the "smtplib" Python package to be able to send an email if needed. Utilized the "time" and "datetime" Python packages to set a daily timer that will check and scan the webpage for any price changes. Utilized the "BeautifulSoup" Python library to pull data from the HTML and then use it.
